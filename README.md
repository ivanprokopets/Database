1. Create tables: zoo, bird, mammal, cage. Each zoo has several animals from each species. Each zoo has several frames.
2. Add an auto-incremental ID plus a minimum of 4 other fields to each table. I leave the field types for my own interpretation.
3. Add 3 zoo, 5 animals from each species and 7 frames for each zoo.
4. List the names of all animals whose name contains the selected letter (it cannot be the first or last letter).
5. List all birds that are in one selected zoo (you need to combine tables)
6. Transfer the selected species to another zoo.
